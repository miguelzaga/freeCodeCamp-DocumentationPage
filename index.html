            <p>Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML
                is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
                For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into
                multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>

                You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our
                Introduction to HTML module first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the
                same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
                and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.
            </p>
            <p>Before starting in this topic you should also:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be familiar with using computers and</li>

                <h2>CSS syntax</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to
                particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my
                page to be shown as large red text."
            </p>
            <p>
                The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
            </p>
            <p class="p-code">
                <code>
                    h1 { <br>
                        <span class="code-indented">color: red; <br> </span>
                        <span class="code-indented">font-size: 5em; <br> </span>                        
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case
                we are styling level one headings.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the
                form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting,
                then a value that we'd like to give the property.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different
                allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color
                property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can
                take various size units as a value.
            </p>
            <p class="p-code">
                <code>
                    h1 { <br>
                        <span class="code-indented">color: red; <br></span>
                        <span class="code-indented">font-size: 5em; <br></span>
                    } <br>
                    <br>
                    p { <br>
                        <span class="code-indented">color: black; <br></span>
                        
                    }
                </code>

            <header>
                <h2>Adding CSS to our document</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it
                to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from
                the head of your document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension
                shows that this is a CSS file
            </p>

            <p>
                To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML
                document:
            </p>

            <p class="p-code">
                <code>
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Styling_HTML_elements">
            <header>
                <h2>Styling HTML elements</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We
                do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element
                name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs
                green you would use:
            </p>

            <p class="p-code">
                <code>
                    p { <br>
                    <span class="code-indented">color: green; <br></span>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all
                paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:
            </p>

            <p class="p-code">
                <code>
                    p, li { <br>
                    <span class="code-indented">color: green; <br></span>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>

                <h2>Changing the default behavior of elements</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how
                the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and
                our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles,
                which they apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and
                we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in
                pretty much the same way.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by
                choosing the HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. A
                good example is our &lt;ul&gt;, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want
                those bullets I can remove them like so:
            </p>

            <p class="p-code">
                <code>
                    li { <br>
                    <span class="code-indented">list-style-type: none; <br></span>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
